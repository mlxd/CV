%{I am enquiring about the advertised position ``'' you have advterised on LinkedIn.
%The topics covered on this year's programme are very relevant to my areas of study as part of my PhD thesis.
%During my first year of PhD studies at University College Cork (UCC) under Thomas Busch I have worked on coherent atomic control using atom-chip structures.
%Employing the matter-wave analogue of STIRAP, coherent tunneling via adiabatic passage (CTAP) as outlined by Eckert et al (doi:10.1016/j.optcom.2006.02.056), and extending the work carried out by 
%O'Sullivan et al. (doi:10.1088/0031-8949/2010/T140/014029) on 2D trapping potentials, a fully experimentally realisable 3D system was devised.  Simulations of our proposed system showed verification of the CTAP process, wherein we were able to show transfer fidelities of 99.8\% for counter-intuitive waveguide arrangements, and verification of the difficulties with direct tunneling via intuitive arrangements.
%I presented this work at DPG 2012, with the final version of the resulting paper currently being finalised.
%Upon completion of this body of work, I have commenced work on analysing vortex dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates. I wish to investigate the dynamics of a vortex lattice structure wherein, given sufficient rotation, the vortices will form an Abrikosov lattice pattern in the ground-state. Given careful choice of lattice spacings, periodic pulsing of an optical lattice pattern may yield dynamics akin to that of a delta-kicked harmonic oscillator, and allow for a means of visualising quantum turbulent or chaotic behaviour. As part of this work I have 
%developed a program for performing integration of the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation which outperforms equivalent programs in Fortran, C and Matlab for achieving results in short timescales.
%More recently, having transferred to the graduate programme at Okinawa Institute of Science \& Technology (OIST), I have gained more variety in my studies. As a formal requirement, one must take coursework both inside and outside the area of proposed specialisation. I have spent time working in a cryo-electron microscopy biology group, 
%and taken courses on protein crystallization and in single particle tomography and 3D molecular reconstruction. Given my diverse background, 
%having spent some time in industry before pursuing PhD study, and resulting work carried out as part of the OIST PhD programme, I may offer a unique
%perspective on many topics. Having a background in high-performance computing I believe is also beneficial, and I may offer insight to many others
%who wish to perform simulations of complex physical systems in reasonable timescales. Lastly, this school would also offer the ability for me to build my academic network with the possibility of developing future collaborative efforts with other such attendees. It is for these reasons that I wish to attend this summer school.

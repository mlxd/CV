    I am writing to express interest in the position advertised as ``POSXYZ''. Coming from a physics background, I have strong skills in computational work that I know will be beneficial and apt for the role. My area of specialisation in theoretical cold atomic physics, with an emphasis on numerical solutions. I have worked extensively on developing high performance routines using CUDA for performing numerical integration of time dependent Schr\"odinger-like problems. This has been performance tested, and shown to outperform well-developed programs in Fortran, C and Matlab, and I would be happy to share these results with you. These numerics allowed the study of physical systems otherwise difficult without the use of a supercomputer, and even exceeding in many cases. The studies yielded several papers on the resulting physics.

    During my time in the graduate programme at Okinawa Institute of Science \& Technology Graduate University (OIST), I have gained a variety in my studies and experiences. As a formal requirement, one must take coursework both inside and outside the area of proposed specialisation. I have spent time working in a cryo-electron microscopy, taken courses on protein crystallization, in single particle tomography and 3D molecular reconstruction. Given my diverse background, having spent some time in industry before pursuing PhD study, and resulting work at OIST, I may offer a unique perspective on many issues. Having a background in high-performance computing I believe is also beneficial, and I may offer insight to find solutions to complex problems.

    I have also been elected to Chair of the Student Assembly and held this position for the full length of term, 2015-2016. Through hard work we were able to directly influence many new rules and policies of this growing university, of which I am happy to discuss.

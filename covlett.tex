    I am writing to express interest in working as a postdoctoral researcher for the advertisted position in theoretical cold atom and many-body physics (852136). I have spent my PhD time at the newly formed Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Japan, and also briefly at University College Cork, Ireland. My area of specialization is in theoretical cold atomic physics, specifically on the dynamics of Bose--Einstein condensates. My PhD work aims to understand the dynamics of perturbations on quantum states with large values of angular momentum. Specifically, I have worked primarily on understanding the dynamics of superfluid dynamics and quantum vortices. For these studies I have gained expertise in computational techniques that I know will be beneficial and apt for many different systems.

    Understanding the behaviour of Bose--Einstein condensate vortex lattices can help with engineering quantum states for future technologies. Ideally, they can be used for long-term memory storage in quantum computing systems as they are topologically protected and are very robust. They also allow the study of quantum mechanical effects on mesoscopic scales, and the inherent periodicity makes them a great tool for simulating condensed matter physics. Furthermore, perturbed vortex lattices can be used to investigate turbulent, and possibly chaotic, quantum behaviour. While turbulent classical systems are notoriously hard to understand and control, quantum turbulence is thought to offer a more controllable route due to the quantisation condition of the circulation. It is therefore of large interest to develop new tools for manipulating and engineering specific states or rotating condensates.

    In my PhD thesis work I concentrate on two types of perturbations to the equilibrium state of a rapidly rotating condensate system: i) the modification of the phonon spectrum of the condensate which does not influence the angular momentum, in particular through the use of a kicked optical potential; ii) the direct control of the topological excitations, and hence the angular momentum, which is performed with direct phase engineering of the wavefunction. Both methods are experimentally realisable using currently available state-of-the-art experimental control techniques. Using these techniques I have studied the robustness of the vortex lattice system, and investigated order-to-disorder and the creation of topological defects.

    For a better understanding of these systems I have worked extensively on developing high-performance simulation software using CUDA. The resulting software methods have been independently performance tested, and have been shown to outperform well-established and mature software in C/C++ and \textsc{MATLAB}. If requested, I will be happy to share these results with you. The performance of these algorithms have allowed for the solution of otherwise numerically difficult system parameters in short time-scales, with several publications as a result.

    During my time in the graduate programme at Okinawa Institute of Science \& Technology Graduate University (OIST), I have also gained a variety of experience in many areas outside my specialisation. As a formal requirement, one must undertake coursework both inside and outside the area of proposed specialisation. I have spent time working with cryo-electron microscopy, protein crystallization, single particle tomography, 3D molecular reconstruction, fluid mechanics, and optics. Given my diverse background, having spent some time in industry before pursuing PhD study, my resulting work at OIST, as well as my experiences to date, I may offer a unique perspective to a variety of problems.

    While I have listed my work on quantum dynamics using HPC methods, my interests for future work are not limited to these systems. I have a large interest in the use of high-performance numerical methods for solving real-world problems, as well as those for further advancing quantum technologies. The use of machine learning techniques are becoming more widespread in many disciplines, and I am curious to understand their application to problems of physical systems. Performance optimisation of software codes is also a passion of mine, and I have attained a great deal of experience with this during my PhD.

    Developing algorithms for high-performance numerical technologies such as GPU computing and Intel Xeon Phi's can allow for acquiring and analysing interesting data in many emerging fields. While I have mentioned these as examples, I am keen to undertake work on interesting problems, and expand my set of skills and experiences. I intend to aim at improving numerical codebases for examining complex condensate systems, where I currently am working on a collaborative codebase for investigating the use of aritificial gauge fields in condensate systems. As artificial gauge fields in condensates are becoming a popular topic, I expect this to be a useful set of tools to better understand the behaviour of these systems.

    Outside of my recent academic pursuits, I have also been elected to Chair of the Student Assembly and held this position for the full length of term, 2015-2016. Through hard work, the Student Council and I were able to directly influence many new rules and policies of this growing university.

    If you find that I may be a suitable for a position, I would be more than happy to better discuss my possible contributions in person, or via Skype. Please do not hesitate to get in touch for further information.
